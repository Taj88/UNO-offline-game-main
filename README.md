# UNO-offline-game

Inspired by [UNO](https://uno-online.io/) - a popular card game designed for players of all ages, typically played with 2â€“10 participants.

## Objective

The objective of the game is to be the first player to score a set number of points, usually by eliminating all the cards in your hand while strategically using action cards to disrupt opponents.

## Technologies Used

## How to Play

1. Shuffle the deck and deal 7 cards to each player.
2. Place the remaining cards face down to form a draw pile.
3. Turn over the top card of the draw pile to start the discard pile.
4. Players take turns matching a card from their hand with the top card of the discard pile by either color or number.
5. Use action cards to disrupt opponents and change the flow of the game.
6. The first player to get rid of all their cards wins the round.
